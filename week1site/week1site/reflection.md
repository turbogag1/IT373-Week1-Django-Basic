IT 373 Week 1 Reflection

Setting up the development environment for Django was both challenging and rewarding. At first, I struggled with ensuring that the correct Python version was installed, as my system default pointed to an outdated one. I resolved this by downloading and installing the latest version of Python, then verifying it with the `python --version` command. Another challenge was activating the virtual environment, since PowerShell had restrictions on running scripts. I fixed this by adjusting the execution policy and then successfully activated the venv. Installing Django was straightforward, but I had to confirm the version to avoid compatibility issues. Running the development server for the first time was exciting, although I initially encountered errors due to missing dependencies, which were solved by rechecking my `pip install` commands. Finally, setting up Git and linking it to my remote repository on GitHub required generating an SSH key and testing the connection. Overall, the process taught me patience and the importance of carefully reading error messages. Each problem I faced became an opportunity to strengthen my troubleshooting skills and gain more confidence in working with Django environments.
